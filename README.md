# Enhancing-Information-Retrieval-Through-Vector-Based-Semantic-Search-System
## Project Goal
The main goal is to improve the efficiency of searching for the latest announcements on the NYCU Department of Computer Science website. This project aims to enhance information retrieval capabilities by implementing a vector-based semantic search system. By utilizing advanced linear algebra techniques and machine learning models, the system can understand and retrieve information based on the semantic intent of the queries, rather than relying solely on keyword matching.
