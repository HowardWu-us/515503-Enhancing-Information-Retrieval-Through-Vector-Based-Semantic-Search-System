\section{Discussion}

The result of our semantic search engine indicates the significant advantages of using Word2Vec for information retrieval. The high MMR score of the queries like “NVIDIA Alternative Service” and “AI Competition” shows that it can effectively capture the semantic relationship and contextual relevance even when the exact keywords are missing. However, there are queries with a lower average MMR score which proves that it is not fully optimized yet. The potential of it is highly evident. If it is further optimized, we believe it will become mainstream in the foreseeable future.
