\section{Results}
We tested the performance of our semantic search engine using 10 real-world queries. The results were evaluated using the MRR metric, which assesses the rank of the correct result across multiple queries. The system performed well, with queries such as “NVIDIA Alternative Service” and “AI Competition” ranking first with a perfect score of 1.00. Other queries showed mixed results, with an average MRR score of 0.70. A detailed description of the testing methodology can be found in the appendix.
