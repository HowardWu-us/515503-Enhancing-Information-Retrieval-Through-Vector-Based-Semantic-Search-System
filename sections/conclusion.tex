\section{Conclusion}
Linear algebra plays a crucial role in building efficient and effective semantic search systems. Through the use of Word2Vec, vector search, and cosine similarity, we were able to improve the accuracy of search engines, providing results that better align with user intent. Future work will focus on optimizing the model for different languages and enhancing the user experience by reducing language translation distortions.
