\section{Introduction}

When searching for articles on the Computer Science department website, it’s often difficult to find the desired information. This is mainly because the search system relies on exact keyword matching, so if the input title doesn’t exactly match what’s in the database, the article can’t be found. This issue becomes even more prominent when articles contain a mix of Chinese and English.
After applying Word2Vec and vector search technologies, we can find articles using any words that have similar meanings. Our project explores semantic search as a solution, particularly focusing on the use of Word2Vec and vector search.By incorporating this technology into search engines, we aim to provide more accurate and contextually relevant results for users.
